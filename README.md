# Flight-delay-predictor

This is an updated and new version of a group project found in the following repo: https://github.com/rj-pal/mid-term-project-I

The goal of this repo is one of continuous improvement and refinement of the above project. I hope to clean up, update and explore this project in more detail in an attempt to improve upon and refine the original models. In addition, I would like to use it as a learning opportunity to enhance both my programming and machine learning skills.

- Update March 9: Added an updated version of my notebook using my own custom-made class.
